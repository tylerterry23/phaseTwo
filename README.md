# What is The Goal of Phase Two? 

Obtaining fitness goals is a true achievement that does not at all come easy. A
common problem for newer gym goers is the difficulty or not seeing the progress
they hoped for. Phase Two’s goal is to help gym goers by keeping track of user
information and as well as providing feedback based on that information. Taking
some of the weight off of people's shoulders while helping them achieve their
goals faster is the main idea. Although there are applications similar to Phase Two
a few key changes and features allow for this app to differ from the competition.

<br><br><br>

## Application Frontend - CSS (Bootstrap 3.0.0 Framework)
This is a web application, allowing users to manipulate database information. To
store health and fitness information. CSS along with the bootstrap framework will
be used for all styling.
CSS is already powerful when it comes to making style changes but when
combined with Bootstrap framework it becomes ever greater. A few features that
were implemented with bootstrap the sits overall grid design, panel configuration 
and style, as well as some great page navigation looks.

<br>

### Corresponding Key Front End Features:

<b> 1. Navigation </b> - Starting at the top of the application, bootstrap is used to
display two navigation bars, one above and one below. Two navbars
allow for a simple and aesthetically pleasing navigation experience for
the user. CSS is also utilized on top of the bootstrap styling to better fit
the needs of site.
2. Forms / Panels - Handling user input is
important and can be tricky. This is why it

<b> 2. Forms / Panels </b> - Handling user input is
important and can be tricky. This is why it
is important to display an aesthetically
simple design even for the most
complicated input forms. Bootstrap offers
great panel styling options as well as form
control abilities ensuring everything is
lined up, pretty, and operational.

<br>

<b> 3. Grid System </b> - Above all else i consider the grid system greatest frontend
aspect. Allowing for a smooth display of forms, charts, text, etc... in
aesthetically pleasing and easy to see positions. Simplicity and understanding
is key in a user data dependent front end.

<br><br><br>

## Application Backend - PHP / JavaScript / MySQL
Being such a data heavy application a good back end is essential. Phase Two uses
PHP and JavaScript retrieving, using, deleting, and or manipulating data as well as
implementing various different dynamic features to allow for smoother data entry.

<br>

<b> PHP </b> is known to be good for its lightning fast dynamic attributes but its main use
in this application is interaction with the MyQSL database. Being able to quickly and
safely add, retrieve, delete, and alter information is vital and PHP allows this app to
do just that.

<br>

<b> Specific PHP advantages </b>

&emsp; &emsp;● Easily connect them to a database with very fast speeds even when the
internet is slow.<br>
&emsp; &emsp;● Works very well with plenty of other languages just as it is used in
conjunction with JavaScript in this project

<br>

<b> JavaScript </b> in this application is only lightly used but does provide key features.
Use of function and function calls allow information to be retrieved without having
to do full POST / GET request which to many can become detrimental. JavaScript is
also used to implement some dynamic attributes as well again giving the application
more life.

<br>

<b> Specific JavaScript advantages </b>

&emsp; &emsp;●executed on a client environment to save lots of bandwidth and make the
execution process fast.<br>
&emsp; &emsp;●support all modern browsers and produce an equivalent result.<br>
&emsp; &emsp;●JavaScript also works quite well with many other languages.

<br>

<b> MySQL </b> can be considered the heart of this application. All data is moved to
MySQL through database tables. Using mySQL, along with a strong surrounding
back end, ensures stored data is safe while strongly decreasing the need for any
data duplication improving space, time, and money if applicable.
